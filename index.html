		<h2>Marriage and Marriage Traditions in Vietnam</h2><br>
		<div class="sidebar">Vietnam is a beautiful country located in Southeast Asia, and just like other cultures,
    it has its unique customs and traditions, especially when it comes to marriage. 
    In this presentation, we will explore some of the common marriage traditions and practices in Vietnam.<br><br><br>
    <b>The Ring</b><br>
    The Vietnamese do not typically exchange rings during the wedding ceremony.
    Instead, they have a tradition where both the bride and groom exchange their wedding bands a few days before the wedding day. 
    The rings are made of gold, and it is believed that the gold represents the long-lasting love and commitment that the couple has for each other.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Wedding Dress</b><br>
    In Vietnam, the wedding dress is usually a traditional Ao Dai, which is a long dress with a high collar and long sleeves,
    and it is usually in red or pink, which are considered lucky colors. The dress is often adorned with intricate details and embroidery.
    The bride usually wears a traditional hat called a Non La, which is a conical hat made of palm leaves.
    <br><br>
    <b>Ceremonies and Events</b><br>
    The Vietnamese wedding ceremony typically lasts for one day, with a series of rituals and customs that take place.
    Before the wedding day, there are often pre-wedding parties and events, such as the engagement ceremony,
    which is when the groom's family presents gifts to the bride's family as a symbol of their commitment to the marriage.
    <br><br><b>The Wedding Location</b><br>
    The wedding ceremony usually takes place at the bride's family home, with a decorated altar that is set up for the occasion.
    However, some couples opt for a modern wedding, which may take place at a hotel or wedding hall.
    <br><br><b>Paying for the Wedding</b><br>
    Traditionally, the groom's family pays for the wedding, including the bride's dowry, but nowadays, it is not uncommon for the couple to pay for their own wedding.
    <br><br><b>Food and Superstitions</b><br>
    Food plays an essential role in Vietnamese weddings.
    Traditional dishes such as Banh Chung (sticky rice cake) and Banh Cuon (steamed rice rolls) are often served during the wedding banquet.
    In terms of superstitions, the Vietnamese believe that it is unlucky to get married in the lunar seventh month or lunar thirteenth month.
    Red is considered a lucky color, while black and white are considered unlucky.
    <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br>
    In conclusion, Vietnamese wedding traditions and practices are steeped in history and culture.
    The wedding day is an important event that is celebrated with family and friends,
    and it is a time to honor the union of two families. From the traditional Ao Dai dress to the delicious food and superstitions,
    Vietnamese weddings are truly a unique and beautiful experience.
